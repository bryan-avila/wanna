# What is this?
This is a Python application that uses tkinter/ttkboostrap to create the GUI. With this application, you may add a streaming service
and any shows that belong to that service that you'd like to watch. In other words, shows you wanna watch!

# The Set Up
1) Ensure that you pip installed the following:
   * ttkboostrap
   * pymongo

2) Either run the python file off an IDE of your choice OR run it via CMD prompt with `python wanna.py`
